# Welcome!

I'm currently in the process of editing this site and learning how to use GitHub; call me a n00b if you want. This GitHub page will host my coding projects sometime in the near future. Until then, checkout my recently launched [personal website](https://bit.ly/DylanOkihiro) for more info about me.
